Sweet pet by day, hunter by night. She sleeps.
He’s dead. A gift. Retracts her claws.
So that my soul may but ascend to Heaven…
By this still hearth, among these barren crags
Unequal laws unto a savage race…

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools 
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! 

Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage 
And then is heard no more: it is a tale 
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury 
Signifying nothing. 
What is the boy now, who has lost his ball
What, what is he to do? I saw it go 

Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then 
Merrily over-there it is in the water!
His words are like doom
He calls me a fool and he calls me a friend
But who is the monster? I just cannot tell
life is like a long cartoon movie clip
and the universe
not as monstrous sad or distressed
then look what we got
They waited long time
That’s what we’re talking about.
