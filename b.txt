I will teach you how to swear
Long the legs has a hare
You’ll faint, you look so blair
Any crossing costs a fare
What’s so bright, what a glare
I have something to repair
A pirate can be also a corsair
But they use no good skin care
During sunset gets lens flare
And to breathe you use some air
No integers to declare
This grade would be unfair
Rectangle is not a square
I’ve still got it to prepare
You can fail, so be aware
I have nothing to forswear
Need two values to compare
Read this and you will be in despair
Teddy bear is not a real bear
You don’t seem to brush your hair
