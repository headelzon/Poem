Like on a beautiful blue Danube
This shall not be rude
If you like to eat dog food
Paul McCartney sings ‘Hey Jude’
I am never in right mood
Nothing worse than two pages glued
His new book not yet reviewed
And your licence be renewed
I will never get tattooed
Nothing left there to conclude
Wow, that move was shrewd
